I belong to a Jain family and we live in Uttar Pradesh,which is the land of farmers in India.
This state has so much diversity of religions and cultures which make me respect all sort of
diversity and made me accustomed to it.I live in a joint family with my parents and paternal 
uncle aunt and grandmother.Living together has imposed a kind of discipline in me,understanding of
mutual adjustment and given a feeling of camaraderie.My father is businessman and a farmer he owns
a business of property and some land for agriculture.I aspire to help in business,and maybe with 
this gained knowledge,I can help him in business decisions.My mother is homemaker.My mother's skillful
handling of mood swings and sensitivties,equipped me to deal with even the toughest of clients and her
determination to learn new things has always motivated me to keep learning.I have one brother ,4 years 
younger to me.My parents have given me independent environment.They tought me honesty,truth,compassion,
kindness and how to care for people.Also,they have encouraged me to take risks,to boldly go.They taught
me that greatest danger in life is not taking any risk.These learning will definately help me to deal with
upcoming challenges.
