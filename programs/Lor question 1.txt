I have been an engineering aspirant from the last 3 years and right now I am in my final year and have been dealing with
some real life problems.I am very enthusiatic about the technology and changes it brings to the Humanity for thier greater
good.That's one of the reaso,I have opted for computer science branch at the starting of my ciricullum.Whole of the sytem
here is pretty good and modules are structured in a pertinent fashion with respect to suitable timeline.But being a computer
Science under graduate I still feels that I am confined to particular syllabus which have hampered me from exploring the various
fields and let me stick to some obselete syllabus. And I still feels their are much more possiblities in the various specilization
which should need to be contemplated in order to find out much more optimized solution for some difficult problems.There are loads
of new technology which should be explored ,before dealing with real time problem which includes heavy data intricacies.I have attended
various workshops held in colleges related to deep learning,big data hadoop etc.These workshops have abridge the gaps between learning
of complicated technologies and made the tools and libraries much more accessible.Also, I have-in collabration with team- completed 
project in machine learning which has foment my further interest in Machine learning and Data science.Now,looking at what data science
and machine learning can solve and how important it can be in future for various companies.I see an opportunity to step out and
explore my capablities towards the most in demand technology in future.
