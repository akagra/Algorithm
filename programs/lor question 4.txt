Positive, ambitious attitude: Being an engineering student, we usually are alone handling the pressure. And things become more critical when production environment is involved. I have learnt to remain positive and calm, even in the face of a crisis. I use to be ready to tackle difficult situations by staying focused and doing what is necessary to get . I have also learnt to prioritize my tasks in order to optimize productivity on a daily basis. 
           Thirst for knowledge: I always look forward to the new learnings and knowledge. Beginning with c/c++, I started learning database administration and it is still in progress. I have done various certification as I started developing interest in computer science. Also I have attended various workshop for machine learning which provided brief about R, Hadoop and python. And as a student I know that I does not already know everything there is to know about technology and always look for ways to build new skills and improve the functionality of my problem solving. Whenever new technologies are released, I try to educate myself and evaluate whether it would be a solution to adopt in my exploration.


Teamwork: I am a team player and believe that if you want to achieve a set of target then working individually is not going to achieve that. I have to interact with various classmates.
Leadership: I have developed leadership skills when I got a chance to make projet with 4 of my collegues I was solely responsible for planning the project and deciding monitoring parameters for them. After designing the report, I was responsible for dividing the work among fellows and to take daily follow up.
