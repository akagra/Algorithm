I have completed high school from Saint dominic savio college and secured 58.2% in my high school.At the time of my senior secondary
I have switched it to Macro vision academy and secured 75.2%.After my schooling I have opted to take break of 1 year for comptetive
exam JEE and secured 1,70000 rank out of 1400000 students.I have started my graduation from Lakshmi Narain college of technology &
science in accompany with that I have participated in various hackathons happening online and various extra cirricular activities
during the ongoing cirricullum. During my schooling I have participated in national children science congress with the group of 4 people
and has been honoured with 1st position in whole of the district,After that we have presented whole of the project at state level where
we are honoured with reputation of state child scientist.As well as I was the part of scout group which pedagogue me with basic leadership
skill.

At the commence of my engineering in 1st sem I have discovered various fields and attended the Deep learning seminar hosted
by NVIDIA in IIT Bombay which have enchanced my knowledge and provoke me towards getting more knowledge towards AI.In my 2nd sem I have 
learned the basic prerequisite of programming and made myself aware of programming language c/c++.During my sophomore in the 
former semester I have learned the oops based programming and started learning Java on which I have solved basic programming
modules,which made me comfortable towards basic oops fundamental.In latter one I want to elucidate myself towards more knowledge
and I have started learning J2EE and started to understand the working of enterprise application concomitantly I have attended
a seminar on Bigdata and hadoop, which have showed the glimpse of handling large datasets and map reducing programming as well as
I have done NPTEL certification hosted by IIT in "Programming data structure,algorithm through c" and achieve an elite certification.
In the summer break I have grabbed an opportunity of being an Intern in "Netlink software pvt ltd" where I learned of basic working
culture in corporate sector  and I was a java intern as well which have certified my knowlegde towards java.In the begnning of my 
pre-final year I have(with the group of 4 members) presented two papers in conference accredited by IEEE named as "ICACT 2019" hosted by
LNCT group of colleges.The paper has been titled as "Contemplation of machine learning algorithms under distinct datasets." .And 2nd one titled
as "Prediction and analysis of student Performance using Hybrid model of Multilayer perceptron and Random forest".At the end of this semester
I have completed two NPTEL certification .First one in "Database management system" and scored a perfect elite batch followed by second certification
"Design and Analysis of Algorithm" which is also termed as Elite.In the starting of the 6th semester I have attended the workshop "Deep learning and machine
learning" hosted by Bennett univresity in collabration with Nvidia and Amazon AWS.In this semester I have learned version control through Git due to which
the understanding of contributing to open source have developed in me.In the summer break I have completed a summer training in "Java" Hosted By CRISP.
I have also completed a minor project "HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION"  based on machine learning and object detection due to which I have learned the working
of library such as tensorflow,openCV etc.At the end of my 7th semester I have completed project named as "Breast cancer Detection " in which Jupyter notebook is used
and Algorihms(SVM and KNN ) is used.
