Unfortunately,the  media tends to highlight what is sensational at the moment.Society would be better served if the media reported or focused more fully on events 
and trends that will ultimately have the most long-term significance.



History witnesses that an individual who can control the mob can control anything,from the leaders or kings of thrones precendented over the past to the leaders who are
now prevaling and controlling the government all have posses skill of being cogent and voluble.And Politics witnesses that if we potrays lie infront of the people who
are callow continously then that lie will automatically fabrigated to truth.Here,the author presented the topic which is in Harmony with the above phrases,the authors 
claims that "Unfortunately,the media tends to ultimately highlight what is sensational at the moment.Society would be better served if the media reported or focused more fully
on events and trends that will ultimately have the most long-term significance".I totally agree with the author's view and I belive that in todays modern society where
peoples are much addicted to electronic media,social media, printed media and spends barbidinganian time of the day on these medium for getting a sense of knowledge 
and trying to become intellect can easily be polarized by seeing malous content.

 Let us look into todays world where media is totally addicted to gaining the profit by getting the more TRP or else the company will collapse into the insolvency,so by
the conizance of their future muddle. They are much more prone for showing the content which people want to see in order just to entertain the audience irrespective of the
fact whether this content is useful or not,as a result much of the people doesnt know the rudimentary knowledge and policies of government.For example the e-media in 
India have engaged people in mob lynching and cow vegetalism which have camoflauged the deleterious effect of demonitization in the country which is one of the major cause
in the flagging economy of India.Maximum media have engaged themselves into immaterial task and earning TRP due to which the profit of media is increasing and influincing
other media also.To avoid this media should be telltale metticulosly so that attraction will become in right direction.

Now,the second most insourmountable hurdle is that a particular media is getting biased to the one political party and polarizes against another.Due to this normal
population of country getting jaundiced to one party and neglecting others because the media have succesfully arcane the deeds of other party.Due to this,jaggaurnaut
of charisma of one leader eventually  takes the advantage and party undoubtedly will come to power.This kind of behaviour can be catastrophic in certain nation.

If we excalvate deep into the system peoples are immature about certain thing,if media will also become indolent to any side then how could people will know 
which is the right thing or candidate?.As a ansewer media should also hold their opinion but also show negative side of certain party to which they are partisaned
and underscore the facts of oppostion also so that the nation would'nt be biased and autocratic.Nobody in this world is perfect.It can be judged only on the basis
of comparing their advantage and disadvantages.

At last in sum to all these I want to conclude that media is the gretest medium through which people can understand the scenario which they cant experience themselves
so if much of the population trust media then the media should prone to show what is right and beneficial in the long term instead of presenting what is mellificious
to the human ear in order to increase their revenue in the status quo.Because it will seems good at initial but at last it will harm the nation and the upcoming generation.
